# MTA_App

Many things went well during this project. We were organized, we communicated well in person and remotely (via Slack). We delegated work evenly and we were all able to help each other in various ways when we struggled. 
We even finsihed several days early.

I would have to say we had no serious struggles except that the ideas we first came up with for the app proved to be too idealistic for our MVP.
